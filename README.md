# Introduction to the Web Development:

This repository contains all of the code for each individual lesson and is broken into three sections. HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Each section contains a folder for each lesson that contains all the code for the project that you need.

The code in these projects is only a reference and should not be directly copied. Instead you should be creating your own web site .
